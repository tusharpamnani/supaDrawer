# SupaDrawer

SupaDrawer is a real-time multiplayer drawing board application built with React Native. It leverages Supabase's real-time database capabilities to enable multiple users to draw on a shared canvas simultaneously.

## Features

- Real-time collaborative drawing
- Unique user identifiers with random usernames and colors
- Smooth drawing experience using a custom drawing board component
- Easy channel-based drawing sessions

## Tech Stack

- **React Native**: For building the mobile application.
- **Expo**: For development and building the app.
- **Supabase**: For real-time database and user authentication.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed
- Expo CLI installed (`npm install -g expo-cli`)
- Supabase account and project set up

## Usage

1. **Start a drawing session:**

   Open the app and navigate to a drawing channel by passing the channel name as a parameter in the URL or navigation.

2. **Draw on the canvas:**

   Use your finger or stylus to draw on the canvas. Your drawings will be broadcasted in real-time to other users in the same channel.

3. **Collaborate:**

   Other users joining the same channel will see your drawings and can draw simultaneously on the same canvas.
